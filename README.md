# Wallet App

**Wallet App** is a minimalistic, animated Flutter UI designed to demonstrate various animation techniques within a wallet interface. Built for the Flutter & Friends conference workshop in Stockholm, Sweden, this app showcases how to add visually engaging animations to enhance user interactions.

## Features

- **Onboarding Page**: An animated onboarding screen utilizing implicit and explicit animations.
- **Dismissible Cards**: A stack of animated, dismissible credit cards that users can drag and interact with. Cards animate back into place or fade away depending on the drag direction.
- **Hero Animation & Custom Page Transitions**: Smooth transitions between pages with Flutter's `Hero` widget, offering a visually appealing UI experience.
- **Slide-to-Pay Animation**: A fully interactive, animated slide-to-pay functionality using a combination of implicit and explicit animations.

## Current Status
The frontend has been completed with a fully functional and interactive wallet UI. **Backend integration is under progress**, with plans to include:
- User authentication
- Transaction handling
- Payment processing
